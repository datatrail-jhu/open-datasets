This guide also includes some basic tips for getting the data imported into R in the first place. Before following any of these instructions, make sure you have the tidyverse installed by using this in R: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) "],["datasets.html", "Chapter 2 Datasets 2.1 dslabs 2.2 FiveThiryEight Data 2.3 Kaggle", " Chapter 2 Datasets 2.1 dslabs dslabs There’s 26 datasets already set up in R for you. To use the datasets in this package you need to do the following kind of steps: # Install the package install.packages(&quot;dslabs&quot;) library(dslabs) For the dataset admissions for example, you first need to prep it with data() function and then you can call it as an object. data(admissions) admissions 2.2 FiveThiryEight Data There’s a variety of datasets available as CSVs. Go to the GitHub When you find the dataset you are interested in, click on that folder and then click on the data file you are interested in. Then click Raw. Copy and paste the URL that that brings you to. For example, for the airline-safety dataset, the URL would look like this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/airline-safety/airline-safety.csv Then you can use that URL in a read_csv function like this: airline_safety &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/airline-safety/airline-safety.csv&quot;) 2.3 Kaggle Kaggle has a variety of datasets that are generally available as CSV. You’ll have to make a login before you download, but you can use a Google login. To download a dataset, you can browse them and then when you find one you like, you can download the CSV. It will download it in a zip file. Upload this to your RStudio server using the Upload button. Then you will see a CSV included in that data file and you can use readr::read_csv()to read in the file. For example, for the Data Science Job Salaries dataset, you can click Download and then upload the resulting zip file. Then you can read in the file like: readr::read_csv(&quot;ds_salaries.csv&quot;) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed). You may want to try searching to find the page's new location, or use the table of contents to find the page you are looking for. "]]
