## FiveThiryEight Data

There's a variety of datasets available as CSVs.

[Go to the GitHub](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data)
When you find the dataset you are interested in, click on that folder and then click on the data file you are interested in.
Then click `Raw`.
Copy and paste the URL that that brings you to.
For example, for the `airline-safety` dataset, the URL would look like this:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/airline-safety/airline-safety.csv
```
Then you can use that URL in a read_csv function like this:
```r
airline_safety <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/airline-safety/airline-safety.csv")
```

## Kaggle

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) has a variety of datasets that are generally available as CSV.
You'll have to make a login before you download, but you can use a Google login.

To download a dataset, you can browse them and then when you find one you like, you can download the CSV. It will download it in a zip file. Upload this to your RStudio server using the Upload button.

Then you will see a CSV included in that data file and you can use `readr::read_csv()`to read in the file.

For example, for the [Data Science Job Salaries dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries), you can click `Download` and then upload the resulting zip file. Then you can read in the file like:
```r
readr::read_csv("ds_salaries.csv")
```
